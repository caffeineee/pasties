## ðŸ¦€ pasties

`pasties` is a small markdown-equipped pastebin site written in rust. it uses tokio and axum to handle async routing and the api. the frontend is generated with askama templates, and interacts with the api using `htmx`. 

pasties also depends on `pulldown-cmark` for rendering markdown, although a custom renderer is in the works to add extra functionality. note that pasties is currently under **heavy development,** some features one might expect may be missing.

### running

pasties' developer dependencies are only `cargo` and a compiler for `sass`, although `cargo-watch` is recommended for the following command:

```
cargo watch -x run -w ./src/ -w ./templates/ -c -q
```
